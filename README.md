# Namaste React

**.jsx and .js exxtension doesn't matter, because end of the day everything is JS so don't think too much about extension you can use extension .js or .jsx**

You're absolutely right! The choice between `.js` and `.jsx` extensions doesn't fundamentally change how the JavaScript code behaves. Both extensions ultimately represent JavaScript code. The difference lies more in convention and tooling.

Here's why it doesn't matter much:

1. **JSX is a syntax extension**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript. However, JSX gets transpiled into regular JavaScript code before execution. This means that whether your file has a `.jsx` or `.js` extension, it still gets transformed into JavaScript understood by browsers or Node.js.

2. **Tooling support**: Some development environments or build tools may expect JSX files to have a `.jsx` extension to apply specific transformations or linting rules. However, most modern tools can be configured to handle either extension seamlessly.

3. **Consistency and readability**: Using a `.jsx` extension can provide a visual cue to other developers that the file contains JSX syntax, which might be helpful for readability and maintainability. But again, this is just a convention and not a strict rule.

Ultimately, the choice between `.js` and `.jsx` is often a matter of personal preference or team convention. As long as you and your team are consistent in your choice and your tooling supports it, either extension will work just fine.
